# Object Oriented Programming

This course aims to introduce students to the foundational principles of designing software that is flexible, reusable and maintainable. Students are exposed to the Object-Oriented Programming paradigm and explore how OOP attempts to solve the problem of good software design, while learning of other paradigms such as the functional paradigm. Students explore fundamental Design Patterns in writing and testing of software and their role in architecture of software.

**Topics**:

- Develop an appreciation for elegantly written software, and how to create and maintain well-designed systems;
- Understand different design paradigms and methodologies, their background and application;
- Understand and apply the principles of Object-Oriented Design to solve problems;
- Understand the role of and apply widely used Design Patterns to create extensible designs;
- Develop skills in both creating medium-scale systems from scratch, and working on existing systems as part of the Software Development Life Cycle;
- Work with an enterprise programming language and IDE.

## Assignments

### [Assignment 1: Back in Blackout](./Assignment%201%20Back%20in%20Blackout/Full%20Assignment/README.md)

This assessment aims to provide design experience for a non-trivial system. Students architect and model how multiple satellites will communicate and function with various devices. The form of communication that will be simulated is a simplified version of the modern internet, simply just file transfer. Users can either upload a file to a satellite from a device, download a file from a satellite to a device, or send a file from a satellite to a satellite.

The solution adopts an Object-Oriented approach that utilises concepts such as abstraction, encapsulation, composition, and inheritance.

**Aims**:

- Design and build a system from scratch using the Object-Oriented design process
- Gain experience in implementing an Object-Oriented program with multiple interacting classes
- Develop an appreciation for well-designed software and design principles
- Gain hands on experience with the Java language and Java libraries
- Develop skills in critical thinking and problem solving on an extended piece of work

### [Major Project](./Major%20Project%20Dungeon%20Mania/README.md)

Created the backend for a broswer game using OOP. All game logic is in the backend, the frontend only handling sprites.

**Aims**:

- Apply software design principles and patterns to create well-maintained software solutions
- Synthesise and adapt to changes in requirements
- Practice software design and development in a dynamic team environment using Agile principles
- Work with the Java Programming Language and Java Class Libraries
- Build medium-scale persistent web applications from scratch
- Appreciate issues in the design and development of software
