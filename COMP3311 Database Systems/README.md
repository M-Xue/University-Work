## Assignments

### [Assignment 1: Queries and Functions on BeerDB](https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs3311/22T3/assignments/ass1/index.php)

The goal is to build some useful data access operations on the BeerDB database, which contains a wealth of information about everyone's* favourite beverage, One aim of this assignment is to use SQL queries (packaged as views) to extract such information. Another is to build PlpgSQL functions that can support higher-level activities, such as might be needed in a Web interface.
