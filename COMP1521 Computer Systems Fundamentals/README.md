# Computer Systems Fundamentals

This course provides a programmer's view on how a computer system executes programs, manipulates data and communicates. It enables students to become effective programmers in dealing with issues of performance, portability, and robustness.

**Topics**:
Introduction to the systems-level view of computing, number representation, machine-level programming, representing high-level programs in machine code, memory, input/output, system architectures, operating systems, networks, parallelism/concurrency, communication/synchronisation. Labs and assignment work in C and machine code.

## Assignments
