Designing custom communication protocols for the edge network based on TCP and UDP.

- The application is based on the client-server architecture consisting of one server and multiple clients communicating concurrently as well as peer-to-peer networks.
- Application supports a range of functions that are typically found from the existing edge networks including authentication (between edge devices and the central server), data generation at the side of edge devices, and data sharing between edge devices and the central server, and between one edge device and another edge device.
- Designed custom communication protocols for the edge network based on TCP and UDP.
