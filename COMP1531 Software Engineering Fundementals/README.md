# Software Engineering Fundamentals

This course provides an introduction to software engineering principles: basic software lifecycle concepts, modern development methodologies, conceptual modeling and how these activities relate to programming. It also introduces the basic notions of team-based project management via conducting a project to design, build and deploy a simple web-based application.

**Topics**:

- basic elements of software engineering: including requirements elicitation, analysis and specification; design; construction; verification and validation; deployment; and operation and maintenance
- data modelling
- software engineering methodologies, processes, measurements, tools and techniques
- Web-based system architecture and development practices on Web platforms

## [Major Project](./project-backend/README.md)

Aims:

- To provide students with hands on experience testing, developing, and maintaining a backend server in Python.
- To develop students' problem solving skills in relation to the software development lifecycle.
- Learn to work effectively as part of a team by managing your project, planning, and allocation of responsibilities among the members of your team.
- Gain experience in collaborating through the use of a source control and other associated modern team-based tools.
- Apply appropriate design practices and methodologies in the development of their solution
- Develop an appreciation for product design and an intuition of how a typical customer will use a product.

Used blackbox testing and AGILE project managmement to create a backend for a Microsoft Teams clone web application.

Personally implemented:

- User account creation and authentication
- Editing user information using email verification (sending account information reset code to given email)
- Hosting apllication data in MongoDB cloud services for persistent data
- Implemented typesafety accross the entire backend
- Helped implement pagination of messages between users
