The testDict.c program exists for you to test your Dictionary ADT. At the moment it only contains one test - you can add more comprehensive tests to it if you wish. We recommend testing your Dictionary ADT before using it in your tw program.

The check.sh script generates the expected output for each data file using a giant Unix pipeline (if it doesn't already exist), runs the ./tw program on each data file and compares the expected output with the output of ./tw. It is currently set to use an Nwords value of 100, but you can edit the script to use a different value if you want. Run it with the command

sh check.sh 

The check.sh script requires that you have the data directory/symlink. If you don't have it, refer to the Setting Up section.

You are not required to understand what all of the commands in check.sh are doing, but they might just pique your curiosity to go and have a look at the Unix Programmers Manual (the man command).

At this point, you might ask "If we can do this with a pipeline of Unix tools, why are we bothering to write our own program?". One reason: it'll be much faster. Another reason: to give you practice with implementing trees.


ENTER THIS COMMAND INTO THE TERMINAL: sh check.sh
